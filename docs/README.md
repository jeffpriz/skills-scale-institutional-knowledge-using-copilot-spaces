# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub! This guide serves as your central entry point to understanding how we plan, execute, and deliver projects at OctoAcme.

## Our Approach

At OctoAcme, we believe in **iterative, data-informed delivery** that puts customer value first. Our project management approach is built on these core principles:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in everything we build
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to get feedback early and often
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead who drive accountability
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Continuous improvement**: We encourage feedback, learning, and psychological safety across all teams

## Key Project Management Stages

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible approach:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project charter
2. **Planning** — Break work into actionable increments, identify dependencies, and establish clear timelines
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Build, test, and iterate with regular demos and progress tracking
4. **Risk Management & Communication** — Proactively identify and mitigate risks while keeping stakeholders informed
5. **Release & Deployment** — Deploy features safely with proper testing, rollback plans, and release notes
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements
